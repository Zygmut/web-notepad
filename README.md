<p align="center">A minimal web-based notepad!</p>

## üß† About

### Why

I love minimalism. When I was in my first year of college, I was struggling to keep my phase taking notes on lectures as my handwritting isn't the best. The default notepad on windows worked just fine, but it lacked in ‚ú®desing‚ú® and some times I tought to myself "I could do a better job". I ended up using vim, but not many people like using the command line to take notes. And so, I started to develop this notepad as a way to warm up to my next semester of college

### How is this better from a default notepad

- The design is really minimalistic, reducing posible distractions
- You can customize almost every aspect on the `config file`
- Dark/light mode  

### üåê Language List

At this point in development, we support the following languages:
- English
- Spanish
- Catalan

## üèÅGetting started 

These instructions will get you started on running this web locally to take full advantage of the configuration

## üì© Installation

- Clone this repository via de `clone` command or download de latest release 
- Open the `index.html` with your favorite web browser

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration file can be found in the main folder, besides the `√¨ndex.html`. In it you'll find the list of all posible modificable aspects (without touching the code) that I've thought. Let's go one by one:

<div align="center">

  | font_size       | Default font size                                                      | e.g. 25px                    |
  | animation_speed | Default animation speed. Set to 0 to disable                           | e.g. 0.2s                    |
  | icon_size       | Default icon size                                                      | e.g. 30px                    |
